# React Pokemon Application 

This application is using the Pokemon application to view all pokemon and then an individual pokemon

# Functionality and Approach

I created two main components

  - Card 
  - CardInfo

The Card displays the pokemon with an index, name, and image. 
The CardInfo displays the pokemon stats, more information and the name

# To start the application 
  - npm install 
  - npm run dev
